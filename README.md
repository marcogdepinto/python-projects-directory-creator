# Python projects automatic directory creations

[![made-with-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-1f425f.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

Creating a CSV file of the jobs available at a particular URL of the Amazon.jobs website.

# Why I did this?
To stop creating projects directory by hand and to have a standard template.

# How does this work?
Just run it via command line. All the arguments needed have defaults. If you want to change the arguments add them while launching the script.

To see an example, just take a look at the "MyProject" folder. Please note that actually there is a standard template for all the files, but I have to plan to add a custom one for each file.

**Setup guide**

**How to run it**
- Open a command prompt and ```cd``` into the directory in which the file is saved;
- type ```python makedir.py``` to run it.
